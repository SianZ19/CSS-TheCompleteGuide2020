    <h1>Assignment - Diving Deeper into CSS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Build a nice box (<code>div</code>) with some content (e.g. "I'm a box!"), padding, a border (style it as you want) and some margin.</li>
        <div id="first-box">
            <p>Here is the box</p>
        </div>
        <div id="second-box">
            <p>Here is the second box</p>
        </div>
        <li>If you didn't do it already: Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of the box.</li>
        <li>Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behavior.</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            If not put <code>p</code> tags around the content, the second
            box's top margin was combined with the frist box's bottom
            margin, so that the space between the two boxes' border was
            just 25px, a.k.a the bottom margin of the first-box
        </p>
        <p>
            It's called <b>margin collapse</b>
        </p>

        <br>
        <li>Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.</li>
        <li>Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.</li>
        <li>Position the two boxes next to each other.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Use <code>display: inline-block;</code> </p>
        <br>
        <li>"Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Use <code>display: none;</code> to "hide" the box</p>
        <br>
        <li>Add a hover effect to the the LAST <code>div</code> element. Use pseudo-classes for that.</li>
    </ol>
